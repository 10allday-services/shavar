# The type of list data that will be shipped.  Presumably this has some
# greater impact on the client side but as yet, it isn't used for much
# other than making sure the list's name and type match.
#
# The technical difference between the shavar and digest256 list types
# is that digest256 formatted lists use the entire 32 byte SHA256 hash
# in the list data while shavar formatted list only send the first 4
# bytes of the 32 byte hash.  The client then queries the service if it
# encounters a match for a given hash prefix(the first 4 bytes) to
# retrieve the entire hash for a given prefix.

# URL or relative path to the source data for this list.  Possibilities
# at the moment include:
#
# relative/path/to/the/file
# /absolute/path/to/the/file
# file:///absolute/path/to/the/file
# s3+file:///s3_bucket_name/s3_key_name_which_can_include_slashes
#
# In this usage, "my_s3_bukkit" is the S3 bucket name and
# "faux/path/to/file/moz-abp-shavar.data" is the full key name.  This
# just permits slight simulation of a file name.
# source = s3+file:///my_s3_bukkit/faux/path/to/file/mozpub-track-digest256.data
#
# For basic testing, use the static testing data.
